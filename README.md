# PsychToolBox_VisualStimuli
Code for arbitrary generation of drifting gratings using openGL and the PsychToolBox. Place all three files in the directory */Psychtoolbox/ and then call the Byron_DriftingGrating.m file.  Try Byron_DriftingGrating(1,2,1,20,10,65,10) , which will give a grating with 1 cycle/degree spatial frequency, 2 cycle/second speed, contrast of 1, assumed observer position of 20 cm from the screen, 10 degrees of arc radius (converted to a size on the screen based on the distance to the screen), 65 degree orientation (horizontal bars), and displayed for 10 seconds.
