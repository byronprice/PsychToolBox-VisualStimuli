# PsychToolBox_VisualStimuli
Code for arbitrary generation of drifting gratings using openGL and the PsychToolBox. 

Place all three files in the directory */Psychtoolbox and then call the DriftingSinGrating.m file.  Try as is, i.e. DriftingSinGrating(), which will display 100 tiles, each with its own drifting sinusoidal grating with randomly-generated values for spatial frequency, speed, contrast, and orientation.
